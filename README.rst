Canvassing Utilities
====================

This repository contains code useful for organizing weekly neighborhood
canvassing.  We want to build a network of people facing foreclosure and
eviction who want to stay in their homes and fight back.

We have a dump of foreclosures available at
http://monroe-threebean.rhcloud.com/export.csv and we want to organize those
according to some criteria to make going door-to-door easier.

``make_addresses.py`` is the main script.  Take a look at that file and its
docstrings for more information.
